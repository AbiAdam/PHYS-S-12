# Week 6: Electronic Input Devices

##B. Hand-Crafter Sensor: 

###Capacitive Sensor: 

I used 10K resistors to build the following circuit:

Resultant Values: 
Min = -11
Max = 650

I can control this range with the pressure I apply to the sensor, whether I touch it with my fingers or leave another layer in between, or if I push with both fingers at once as opposed to one against a desk. 

I can also control the range based one the amount of voltage I provide the sensor and the resistors I use in the circuit. 

###Lowering the voltage:
- going from 5V to 3.3V 
- leads to a greater range
Min = -4
Max = 1316

###Changing resistors: 
- Going from 10K to 1K
- Led to a smaller range 
Min = -17
Max = 109
