  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  For the first week/class I created the very website you are using, making use of github and the template provided on the class website. 

  I created the [About Me](./About_Me/index.html) page, complete with a succinct description and picture of me.

  I also wrote a VERY preliminary proposal for a final project, which can be viewed on the [final project page of the website](../13_Final_Project/index.html). 

  Click [here](../index.html) if you want to return to the main page.
