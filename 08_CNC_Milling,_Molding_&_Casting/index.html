  # Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting 

## Milling: 

For the milling, I first created a model in fusion 360 of the model I wanted to create. I made two, because I was unsure how much time it would take and wanted to be able to evaluate the situation before chosing which one to mill. 

Here are the files and images of the designs:

[Sun Milling, Bigger Version](https://a360.co/3PCaIK6).
[Sun Milling, Smaller Version](https://a360.co/3o6GZNY).

I ended up chosing the smaller version becasue the larger one would have been far too time consuming. 

Here are images of the settings for the milling:

Here are the results:
