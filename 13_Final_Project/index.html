  ### Week 13: Final Project

  

  ## Pressure operated musical instrument

  A musical instrument built using photoresistors/thermistors to detect the location of the user's fingers, allowing them to play varied notes without needing to touch an instrument. They would be able to play chords and varying intensities of the notes. The instrument would also be able to change octaves and have a display to show the user what chord/note they are playing. 

  Here are some (very simple) illustration of what I hope to create:

#Project Plan: 

   It would utilize an Arduino and breadboarding, as well as code likely executed in the Arduino IDE (instead of matlab, as we've been using that method for coding in class). This project is basically a more complex version of a more rudimentary project I created last year that follows the same concept (a musical instrument operated based on the varied detection of light/heat from disparate sources). 

   *NEW* Upon further investigation, I've decided to switch to a button operated system. The idea of using brightness or heat just present a whole host of difficulties, such as ambient heat and light, and the difficulty that playing any actual music would require keeping the fingers above the sensors and thus they would be perpetually activated. Pressure avoids many of these issues as the user would have to come into contact with the instrument to make noise, and would eliminate the issue of ambient signals confusing the device. The design would stay much the same despite this change, except now there will be keys like in a real piano, and possibly a system with many buttons in each key to enable the creation of many intensities of the desired note.

  Here is an image of the (very rudimentary) version I created for that project:

#Timeline: 

- Create CAD designs (July 10th)
- Assemble smaller versions of the circuit and write sections of code for proof of concept 
  - make use of existing pressure sensor code and modify it, also begin with the small breadboard before scaling up 
- Write overall psuedocode, draw circuit diagram 
- Conbine into one large circuit, test it. 
- Write the code for the program, utilizing classes for the pressure sensors and integrating the piezo buzzer/speaker I choose
- Prototype the casing 
- Print the casing and different covers for the buttons 
- Assemble it all
  - if there is enough time and the first stages of the plan go smoothly, maybe make a vinyl print for the circuit 
- Prepare for final presentations at the project fair!
