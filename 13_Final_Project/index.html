  ### Week 13: Final Project

  For my final project I am considering the following ideas: 

  ## 1. Light/heat operated musical instrument

  A musical instrument built using photoresistors/thermistors to detect the location of the user's fingers, allowing them to play varied notes without needing to touch an instrument. They would be able to play chords and varying intensities of the notes. The instrument would also be able to change octaves and have a display to show the user what chord/note they are playing. 

  Here is a (very simple) illustration of what I hope to create:

   It would utilize an Arduino and breadboarding, as well as code likely executed in MatLab. This project is basically a more complex version of a more rudimentary project I created last year that follows the same concept (a musical instrument operated based on the varied detection of light/heat from disparate sources). 

  Here is an image of the (very rudimentary) version I created for that project:

  ## 2. ChoreBot (not the final name)

  A robot equipped with a camera that would scan around the room in which it is placed and recognize undone chores, such as unmade beds, clothes on the floor, etc. This robot would then send out messages over wifi reminding the room's occupant to do their chores. 

  The inspiration for this came from me constantly forgetting to do my chores and wishing I had a apparatus to rmeind me when I forget.
