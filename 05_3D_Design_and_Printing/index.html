##Print: 

###Process of creation: 

Made a sketch of a rectangle with eight holes in it, then extruded, then extruded another rectangle within that rectangle to create a cut out area inside.  

Combined them all into one component, export, slice, and make smaller for size and time reasons, added a brim.  

The I printed it, and the first few times it didn't work because of an error in my model, and because I needed to slow down the printer. So I remedied those issues and ended up being successful and printing what I had designed!

###Here are all the files for this print:

###Lessons: 

Further brainstorming has led me to conclude that I should use buttons instead of photoresistors/thermisters for the input in my final project. Sadly, that makes this design obsolete. However, the many iterations it went through while I was printing it have taught me to always triple check my models before printing them, and to go to the source to try and locate mistakes before all else.

##Photogrammetry: 

Here is a [link](https://www.scandy.co/apps/scandy-pro) to the app I used, Scandy.

Here is a link to my scan:

!Note! I do not recommend this app as it only uses the selfie camera and greatly limits the number of scans you can take.
